# Lesson Twelve

In this lesson, you are going to combine your knowledge on the state and effect hooks to create your own component. Here are the requirements:

1. Must include a form with at least two text inputs, one of which should take in a user name, and a submit button.

2. Must have a <p> that tracks how many times the submit button has been clicked.

3. All inputs must clear after submit is pressed.

4. The user should see the name they last submitted on the document title.

Please remember to use descriptive naming conventions for all variables and functions. Any other developer should be able to read your code and understand the general purpose of each line based on what you have named elements in your code.
