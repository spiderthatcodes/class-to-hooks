# Lesson Fourteen

The other method of style sheet management is to have a style file associated with each individual component, with only project-wide styling added to a top level component.

Notice in the file structure of this project, that each lesson and its associated component has been placed in an individual folder. This organizing principle should also extend to a style file. Good naming conventions for style files include either style.css or the name of the associated component. No matter what you choose, 
be consistent.

In this folder, create a new jsx file and call it Card.jsx. Add an associated css file. In the Card file, create a basic Card component. It should have an <h2> and a <p>. For now, add placeholder text to these elements.

Now, add styling to your css file. At minimum, it should include a border around the whole card. However, if you would like to add more elaborate styling elements, feel free. This component will be used in later lessons, so you can also add to the styling more later.
