# Lesson Sixteen

With some exceptions, the lessons from now on will proceed a little differently. The instructions will continue as have been established in the previous 15 activities, but your work will now begin to create an example React project of your own. You will continue to learn and master new techniques, but within the broader scope of an example website.

Let's get started!

## Directions

1. Create a new folder in the src folder called components.

2. Inside the components folder, create another folder called Home.

3. Inside the Home folder, create a Home component and associated stylesheet.

4. For now, all your Home component needs is an <h1> that reads "Example React Project".

5. Use your css file to add a color other than black to the <h1>.

6. Open App.js and replace the <h1> with your Home component.

7. Add an id of wrapper to the <div> in App.js. Use that id to give the page a max-width of 1200px in index.css, and set the margin to auto.
