# Lesson Two

The objective for this lesson is to write your own component from scratch. Either function components (look at App.js) or es6 syntax (look at One.jsx) is fine, but do not use class components. Your component should include an h1, a p, and an unordered list. Below are some things to keep in mind.

- Although you can name your function whatever you want, general practice is that it should match the name of the file. So, One.jsx has a component named One.

- Notice that the component name should be capitalized.

- You might notice that One.jsx and App.js both have a blank line at the end of the file. This is a Github requirement. Although it will not break your code, it is a good idea to get in the habit of adding that line to the end of every file.

- Make sure to import your code into App.js and render it to your screen
