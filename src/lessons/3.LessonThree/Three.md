# Lesson Three

In this lesson, you are going to create two components, a parent and a child. In PCC, this is done all in one file. While that works, it makes the file difficult to read and is against generally accepted coding practices. So, you are going to create two jsx files in this folder. Name them whatever you want, but remember the best practices that were discussed in lesson two.

## Parent Component Requirements

1. An h1 declaring it is the parent component
2. The import and rendering of the child component

## Child Component Requirements

1. A p element stating that it is the child component

## Last Tasks

1. Import the parent component into App.js and render the component to check your work. 

### Final Considerations

It is important to truly understand the relationship between your components as you import them into various files. In this instance, App is the top level, your parent component is in the middle, and your child component is the lowest level of this relationship. Knowing what level each component is on in relation to others is very important to scope, as will be discussed in later lessons.
