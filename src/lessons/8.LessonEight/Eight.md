# Lesson Eight

In this lesson, the goal is the utilize and expand the knowledge you gained in lessons 6 & 7. You are going to build your own component, add state, and render to the page based on those state values. There is no one "right" answer, it just needs to work. Remember to console.log!

## Directions

1. Create a component in this folder.

2. This component should return 3 buttons and an h1 element. Each button should read "Click Me!". The h1 can just have placeholder text for now.

3. Create three state variables, one for each button. Remember to use camelCase, and try to avoid abbreviations in your naming conventions. Descriptive names are best.

4. When each button is clicked, it should change the associated state value to true, but the other values to false

5. Add logic to have your h1 read "One is True" if the first button is clicked, "Two is True" if the second is clicked, and "Three is True" if the third one is clicked.
