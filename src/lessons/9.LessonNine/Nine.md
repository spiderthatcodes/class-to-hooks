# Lesson Nine

Now that you understand how to set and manipulate state with hooks, you can create a working form. The basic principles of this are the same as you learned with class components.

In Nine.jsx, the basics of a form have been created for you. There are just a few things you need to add to get it working. 

## Directions

1. Create a state value for your input. The initial value should be an empty string.

2. Fix the value on the input, and add the onChange. If you need a reminder how the onChange should work, check your PCC lessons.

3. Once your input is working successfully, add logic to your handleSubmit to clear the text input. You might also add a console.log to show the submitted value. Eventually, the handleClick contain more code, but for now a console.log is fine.
